# Heros_of_Pymoli_PyCity_Schools_Project

Heros of Pymoli:
  We were assigned the task of analyzing the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. The game was a free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The first task, the company wanted us to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

PyCity Schools:
  We were helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. We were asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. we were given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. We needed to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
